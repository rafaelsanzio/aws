# Best Practices

- Don't use the root account except for AWS account setup
- One physical user = One AWS user
- Assign users to groups and assign permissions to group
- Create a strong password policy
- Use and enforce the use of Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Create and use Roles for giving permissions to AWS services
- Use Access Keys for Programmatic Access (CLI/SDK)
- Audit permissions of your account with the IAM Credentials Report
- Never share IAM users & Access Keys

# Summary

- Users: mapped to a physical user, has a password for AWS Console
- Groups: contains users only
- Policies: JSON document that outlines permissions for users or groups
- Roles: for EC2 instances or AWS services
- Security: MFA + Password Policy
- Access Keys: access AWS using the CLI or SDK
- Audit: IAM Credential Reports and IAM Access Advisor
