# Elastic Load Balancer

	- Sticky Sessions
		- The same client is always redirected to the same instance behind a load balancer
		- Works for CLB and ALB
		- The cookie user for stickiness has an expiration date you control
		- Use case: make sure the user doesn't lose his session data
		- Enabling it, may bring imbalance to the load over the backend EC2 instances

		- Cookie Names 
			
			- Application-based Cookies
				- Custom cookie: generated by target, can include any custom attributes required by the application
				- Application cookie: generated by load balancer, cookie name is AWSALBAPP
			
			- Duration-based Cookies
				- Generated by the load balancer
				- Cookie name is AWSALB for ALB, AWSELB for CLB 

	- Cross-Zone Load Balancing
		- With Cross Zone:
			- Each load balancer instance distributes evenly across all registered instances in all AZ
		
		- Without Cross Zone: 
			- Requests are distributed in the instances of the node of the ELB

		- ALB (Application)
			- Always on (can't be disabled)
			- No charges for inter AZ data
		
		- NLB (Network)
			- Disabled for default
			- You pay charges for inter AZ data if enable

		- CLB (Classic)
			- Disabled by default 
			- No charges for inter AZ data if enabled
