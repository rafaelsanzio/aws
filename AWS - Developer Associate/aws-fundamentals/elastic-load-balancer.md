# Elastic Load Balancer

	- Sticky Sessions
		- The same client is always redirected to the same instance behind a load balancer
		- Works for CLB and ALB
		- The cookie user for stickiness has an expiration date you control
		- Use case: make sure the user doesn't lose his session data
		- Enabling it, may bring imbalance to the load over the backend EC2 instances

		- Cookie Names 
			
			- Application-based Cookies
				- Custom cookie: generated by target, can include any custom attributes required by the application
				- Application cookie: generated by load balancer, cookie name is AWSALBAPP
			
			- Duration-based Cookies
				- Generated by the load balancer
				- Cookie name is AWSALB for ALB, AWSELB for CLB
